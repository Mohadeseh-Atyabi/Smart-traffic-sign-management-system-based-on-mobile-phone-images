# Smart-traffic-sign-management-system-based-on-mobile-phone-images
This system is designed to recognize traffic signs in an image and estimate their geographical position by using distance estimation algorithms and the camera's geographical position. Once the location is determined, it can be displayed on Google Maps. I conducted this project as my B.Sc. thesis in the Department of Computer Engineering at Amirkabir University of Technology.
